# DPGDraws Bot

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the bot files are located.
4. Run the `run.bat` file to automatically install the required Python packages and start the bot.

**Note:** If you encounter any issues during the installation process, ensure that Python and pip are correctly set up on your system and added to the system PATH.

## Bot Settings

Before running the bot, you need to set up some configuration parameters in the `.env` file. Follow the steps below to configure the bot:

1. Open the `.env` file in a text editor.
2. Update the following parameters with your own Discord bot token, Discord guild (server) ID, and other settings:

   - `APP_ID`: Replace this with your Discord application ID. You can find your application ID on the Discord Developer Portal after creating a new application.
   - `DISCORD_GUILD`: Replace this with the ID of your Discord guild (server) where the bot will operate. You can get the server ID by enabling Developer Mode in Discord and right-clicking on the server name to copy its ID.
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Replace this with your Discord bot token. You can obtain a bot token by creating a new bot application on the Discord Developer Portal.
   - `PUBLIC_KEY`: Replace this with the public key of your Discord bot. The public key is used for interactions with Discord's Interaction API.
   - `bot_activity_type`: The type of bot activity (1 for playing, 2 for streaming, 3 for listening, 4 for watching).
   - `bot_activity_text`: The text that will be displayed as the bot's activity status (e.g., "Minecraft").
   - `team_select_channel`: The ID of the Discord channel where players can select their teams. Replace this with the channel ID where you want team selection buttons to be displayed.

3. Save the `.env` file after making the changes.

## Text Configurations (text_configs.json)

The bot uses a configuration file named `text_configs.json` to manage text messages, button labels, and responses for various interactions. You can customize this file to change the bot's behavior and messages. Below is an explanation of the key elements in the `text_configs.json` file:
